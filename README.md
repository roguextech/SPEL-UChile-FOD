# Femto-satellite Orbital Deployer (FOD)

This repository contains the PCB design and the source code of a femto-satellite orbital deployer or FOD. This device works by cutting a fishing line with Nichrome wire. The fishing line is normally pressing a hinge lever. When the line is cut, the hinge lever is released end the microcontroller can detect the release status.

The PCB has a transceiver (RFM69HCW) to communicate with the femto-satellite once it is released and a microSD slot to save data. There is also a LED showing the release status, and a reset button.

Current version: 3.0.0
